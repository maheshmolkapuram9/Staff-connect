# WorkFlow:

```text
- Set up React app using Vite
- Configured Vitest with React Testing Library and jsdom
- Integrated Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- set up react router and defined routes set up for different pages
  -- (Dashboard, staff directory, It Requests, Tickets, To Do List, Not Found)

- header has been built
  -- Logo and App name
  -- navigation Menu (Dashboard, staff directory, It Requests, Tickets, To Do List)

  -- Reusuable table
  -- Reusuable table Row
  -- Reusable table Cell

- It Requests form has been built
  -- Reusuable Select dropdown element, TextArea, File input accepting only .pdf or .doc/.docx files
  -- Implemented accessibility features: Proper labeling, keyboard navigation, and live region updates
  -- Provided user feedback on submission status

  -- Refactored StaffTableRow for clean, efficient conditional rendering

- Redux store has been set-up
  -- Configured a centralized Redux store and integrated it with the application
  -- Created a userSlice to manage user-related state
  -- created mocks folder for the mock data
  -- Added a staff.json file containing sample staff records
  -- useStaffDeatils hook is built to fetch data from staff.json (simulated async with setTimeout)
  -- staffDetails data has been fetched and integrated with the table UI
  -- Implemented a Shimmer UI component to elegantly indicate loading states
  -- Gracefully handled both loading and error states, providing clear feedback to users during the fetch process

- To-do slice created to manage to-do tasks
  -- Added a toDo.json file containing sample to-do records
  -- useStaffDeatils hook is built to fetch data from toDo.json (simulated async with setTimeout)
  -- Integrated the to-do list with a table-based UI and implemented error handling to provide user-friendly feedback.
  -- add to-Do form simulated with async, await and setTimeout during submission.
  -- add a to-do form has handled with loading state, form validation and successful addition of new to-do
  -- implemented features (mark completed or not, edit To Do, Delete to do)

- tickets slice created to manage tickets
  -- Added a tickets.json file conatining tickets records
  -- useTicketDetails hook is built to fetch data from tickets.json (simulated async with setTimeout)
  -- Integrated the tickets list with a table-based UI and implemented error handling to provide user-friendly feedback.
  -- IT requests form simulated with async, await and setTimeout during submission.
  -- IT request form is validated and handled loading state and errors

- userSlice created to  handle the userSate (either admin or user)
  -- implemented a feature in staffDirectory, admin can see extra information (last login, Drive
storage, device status) for each user.
  -- implemented a feature in header to toggle between user1, user 2 and Admin (user 3)
  -- implemented a feature to see the number of Open tickets and Pending tasks, updates dynamically (unique data for every user).
  -- showing tickets table & to-do list table in the dashboard
  -- dynamically showing the user name in the dashboard banner

- Tickets and To-Dos are personalised acoording to the user.
  -- every user can only see their tickets and toDos.
  -- every user get the data of open tickets, pending tasks, recent updates from their own data.
  -- added brr media fevicon
  -- more mock data is updated to see the data
```

```

# Assumptions:

```text
- updates are considered as the no.of tickets from today.
```
